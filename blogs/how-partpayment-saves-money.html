            How Part Payment Helps You Reduce EMI or Tenure
        </h1>

        <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
            Loan EMIs run for years, and it’s completely normal to feel the weight of it.
            A part payment is one of the simplest ways to reduce this pressure.  
            Whether you want a lower monthly EMI or you want to finish the loan faster,
            a well-timed part payment can make a huge difference.
        </p>


        <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-800 mt-10 mb-3">
            1. What Exactly Is a Part Payment?
        </h2>

        <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
            A part payment is when you pay extra money towards your loan principal,
            apart from your regular EMI.  
            This reduces your outstanding balance immediately and helps you save interest.
        </p>


        <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-800 mt-10 mb-3">
            2. Why Does a Part Payment Save Interest?
        </h2>

        <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
            Interest is calculated on the remaining principal.  
            When you reduce the principal in the middle of your loan,
            you automatically reduce the total interest payable.
        </p>

        <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
            This is especially powerful in the early and mid stages of a loan,
            when the principal is still high and the interest portion of the EMI dominates.
        </p>


        <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-800 mt-10 mb-3">
            3. Two Ways a Part Payment Helps You
        </h2>

        <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-2">
            After making a part payment, the bank will let you choose between:
        </p>

        <ul class="list-disc ml-6 text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-8">
            <li><strong>Option A: Reduce your EMI</strong></li>
            <li><strong>Option B: Reduce your tenure</strong></li>
        </ul>


        <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold text-gray-800 mb-2">Option A: Reduce Your EMI</h3>

        <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
            This is helpful when monthly budget feels tight.  
            Even a small reduction in EMI can free up money for day-to-day needs.
        </p>

        <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-8">
            If your goal is to reduce financial stress today,
            choosing a lower EMI is usually the right move.
        </p>


        <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold text-gray-800 mb-2">Option B: Reduce Your Tenure</h3>

        <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
            This option gives the maximum interest savings.
            When tenure reduces, your loan closes earlier and you save
            on many months of interest payments.
        </p>

        <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-8">
            If your goal is to become debt-free sooner, reducing the tenure can make a huge difference.
        </p>


        <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-800 mt-10 mb-3">
            4. A Simple Example: How Much Can You Save?
        </h2>

        <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
            Imagine you have a loan with:
        </p>

        <ul class="list-disc ml-6 text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
            <li>Remaining principal: ₹7,50,000</li>
            <li>Interest rate: 11%</li>
            <li>Remaining tenure: 48 months</li>
        </ul>

        <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
            You make a part payment of ₹1,00,000.
        </p>

        <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
            If you choose:
        </p>

        <ul class="list-disc ml-6 text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-8">
            <li><strong>Reduce EMI:</strong> Your monthly EMI becomes lighter,  
                making monthly expenses easier to manage.</li>
            <li><strong>Reduce tenure:</strong> You finish the loan several months earlier  
                and save a significant amount on interest.</li>
        </ul>


        <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-800 mt-10 mb-3">
            5. When Is the Best Time to Make a Part Payment?
        </h2>

        <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
            The earlier you make a part payment, the better the savings.
            This is because interest is highest during the beginning of a loan.
        </p>

        <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
            Even one well-timed part payment in the early years can reduce both your stress
            and your long-term interest.
        </p>


        <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-800 mt-10 mb-3">
            6. The Emotional Side: Why Part Payments Feel So Good
        </h2>

        <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
            Loans often stay in the back of our mind.  
            Even though we pay every month, it can feel like the end is very far away.
        </p>

        <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
            A part payment gives a sense of progress.  
            It feels like you took charge, and that motivation itself helps in planning better.
        </p>
